# Model Evaluation and Refinement

# Model evaluation
  - split data set to training and testing sets
    train\_test\_split
  - cross validation
    cross\_val\_score
    cross\_val\_predict

# Overfitting, Underfitting, Model selection
  - min (training error - test error)

# Ridge regression
  - prevent overfitting

# Grid search
  - hyperparameters
  - select best fit hyper parameters
  - data -> training set, validation set and test set
