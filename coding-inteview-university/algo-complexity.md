# Algorithmic complexity

## Big O
    A function f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist a constant C and a positive number
    n0 such that f(n) <= C(g(n)) for all n > n0

    - upper bound
    - worst case

## Omega
    A function f(n) is Omega(g(n)) if there exist a constant C and a positive number
    n0 such that f(n) >= C(g(n)) for all n > n0

    - lower bound
    - best case

## Theta
    A function f(n) is Theta(g(n)) if f(n) is O(g()) and f(n) is Omega(g(n))

    - average case
